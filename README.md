# Analysis of of theater Kickstarter campaigns

Here, I analyzed the success or failure of Kickstarter campaigns to get funding for theater projects. Analyses are in the file data-1-1-3-StarterBook.xlsx, spread across multiple Excel sheets:

**1. kickstarter:**
Raw data for 4114 Kickstarter campaigns from various categories. 

**2. category statistics:**
Pivot table and bar chart displaying funding outcomes of all theater campaigns

**3. subcategory statsistics:**
Pivot table and bar chart displaying funding outcomes of all plays (a subset of theater campaigns)

**4. launch date outcomes:**
Line graph displaying monthly changes in theater campaign outcomes 

**5. Edinburgh research:**
Data subset focusing on five plays from Edinburgh Festival Fringe

**6. successful US kickstarters:**
Data subset of all successfully-funded plays from the United States

**7. failed US kickstarters:**
Data subset of all US plays that failed to reach their funding goal

**8. descriptive stats:**
Mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles of funding goals and pledged funds, compared between successful and failed US plays

**9. GB musicals:**
Boxplot comparing funding goals and pledged funds for all plays in Great Britain


## Main findings ##

Theater campaigns have a high success rate relative to other types of campaigns. Good news!

Theater campaigns have had the most success in the months of May and June - something to consider when deciding when to kick off your campaign.

Plays specifically (not just theater broadly) also have had a high success rate historically.

![GB_musicals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85725400/170125320-dfdb1954-b711-49d4-b3c4-e387636f4762.png)
Lots of musicals campaigns in Great Britain seem to be setting overly high fundraising goals. Except for outliers, all pledged funds amount to less than the mean funding goal that was asked. Don't set your goal too high! Less than $2000 is probably safest
